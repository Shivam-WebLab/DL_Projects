This is a basic ANN model in order to learn and implement the basics of DL. The project follows the ANN model teached by "Prof. Kirsh Naik". \
Following is the video link from his channel - " https://youtu.be/d2kxUVwWWwU?si=Y6aKIihhsP6eBbps "
Dataset is collected from kaggle - "Churn prediction dataset"

Requirements- I have set up a python environment in Anaconda to implement the project.
Due to compatibility issues and version clashes- following are the versions i have used for all the libraries/dependencies:
1) python- 3.10.x \
2) tensorflow- 2.15.x \
3) numpy- 1.24.3 \
4) Scikit- 1.3.0 \
5) Scipy- 1.10.0 \
6) pandas \
